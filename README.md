# Data Discovery: Pewlett Hackard's Retro Journey ⏪


## Introduction 👩‍💻
Hey there, my name is Jazzy the Creator of this Code. Welcome to my project with Pewlett Hackard as a Data Engineer!

## Background 🧩
Beginning with an analysis of historical data from the 1980s and 1990s, extracted from six CSV files, I'll then proceed to model new tables and data. After configuring them into the SQL database, I'll conduct a thorough analysis, detailed in the "Analysis" section below.

## Key Skills 💻
- Data Modeling
- Data Engineering
- Data Analysis
- SQL Databases

## Analysis Questions📋
1. List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
2. List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
3. List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
4. List the department number for each employee along with that employee’s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
